# Heart-Disease

• Personal project to gain an understanding of some of the machine learning techniques and processes I had heard about during my first year of university.
• Designed a neural network aimed at predicting whether a person had heart disease from certain markers.
• Written in Python and had a final accuracy of 85%.
• Through this project I came to understand the importance of the data that you're working with, I spent a fair amount of time cleaning and sorting the data used for this.
• More could be done to improve the data used for this and accuracy should increase.
